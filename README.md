# MAC-OSX-CIS-Hardening
CAUTION: Please proceed at your own risk. Review each line of the script before you run it to make sure you are satisfied with the controls and they do not conflict with any corporate policies you may have. 

The posted script contains CIS security hardening seetings for MAC OSX (High Sierra and earlier). The majority of the hardening sections were applied, but a few hardening suggestions were removed due to inability to implement via command line. Please see CIS documentation for additional details. 

You will need to run the following command from a SUDO-enabled account:

sudo sh secure_osx_config.sh
