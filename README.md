# MAC-OSX-CIS-Hardening
CIS security hardening seetings for MAC OSX (High Sierra and earlier). The majority of the hardening sections were applied, but a few hardening suggestions were removed due to inability to implement via command line. Please see CIS documentation for details. 

You will need to run the following command from a SUDO-enabled account:

sudo sh secure_osx_config.sh
